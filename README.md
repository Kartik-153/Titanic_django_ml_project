# Titanic_django_ml_project
This project aims to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset for beginners in the field of data science and machine learning. I have implemented this project using Django, a high-level Python web framework, for its simplicity and scalability.
